# factstore

Open source distributed event (fact) sourcing database written in #rust

## GTM

### Week 1:

    Set up the project structure:
        Initialize a new Rust project.
        Create the necessary directories and modules.

    Implement basic event storage:
        Define the event structure.
        Set up file I/O for event storage.
        Implement event appending and reading.

    Design and implement stream management:
        Define stream metadata structure.
        Develop stream creation and retrieval mechanisms.

### Week 2:

    Enhance event storage:
        Add support for event versioning or timestamps.
        Implement basic concurrency control mechanisms.

    Improve stream management:
        Implement stream deletion and update functionalities.

    Begin designing and implementing projections:
        Define the projection logic and structures.
        Start working on basic projection transformations.

### Week 3:

    Refine concurrency control:
        Improve the conflict resolution mechanism.
        Enhance concurrency handling for multiple writers.

    Complete basic projections:
        Implement the remaining transformation logic.
        Test and validate basic projections.

    Start networking and API development:
        Define the API endpoints for event storage, stream management, and projections.
        Set up the necessary networking libraries.

### Week 4:

    Finalize networking and API implementation:
        Implement the handlers for each API endpoint.
        Test the API functionality using appropriate tools (e.g., Postman).

    Perform comprehensive testing:
        Write unit tests for different modules and functionalities.
        Develop integration tests for end-to-end scenarios.

    Begin performance optimization:
        Profile the code and identify areas for optimization.
        Start optimizing critical sections for better performance.

### Week 5:

    Continuation of performance optimization:
        Analyze bottlenecks and apply optimization techniques.
        Conduct benchmarking and evaluate performance improvements.

    Documentation:
        Document the project structure, modules, and APIs.
        Create user guides and installation instructions.
        Update the README file and add relevant project documentation.

    Finalize the project:
        Refactor and clean up code as necessary.
        Perform a thorough code review and resolve any issues.
